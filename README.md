# Discrete Math Problems

[فارسی](./READMEFA.md) / English
These are Discrete Math Problems our Professor told us to solve. Note that these are not the best and most optimal ways of doing these stuff but considering the short time span that I had and the fact that I don't have that much skills, I believe I did Great, and maybe in the future I will update this or make another repo and expand or optimize these stuff;))
